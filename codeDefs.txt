MAESTRO dataset -> labeled?

pathlib -> path objects
glob -> finding pathnames
pretty_midi -> manipulate labeled midi files?

pathlib.Path(<dir>)
pathlib.Path.exists() -> False or True

could explain why vectorization is handy? Do we even use it?


Numpy
------
Ndarray -> N-dimensional array
vector -> 1-D (no diff between column and row vector)
matrix -> 2-D
Tensor -> 3-D or higher

Arrays faster and memory efficient than python datatypes for storage of data.
Arrays are homogeneous -> faster manipulation/computation. -> same data type.

dtype -> element type of array
rank -> #dimensions
shape -> length of dimensions.
axes == dimensions

ndarray class -> for matrices and vectors
